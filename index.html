        <h1>Bots</h1>
        <p>At Drawers we value freedom and openness - we are building on top of an open source protocol XMPP to support "client choice". In addition to Drawers, many other clients such as pidgin provides excellent communication. We extended it by launching "Bots API" to help third party clients to develop bots</p>
        <p>Bots are simply Drawers account that can be public(searchable by everyone - Uber Cabs bot)/private(shell terminal). It can do anything such as remote command execution, booking a cab, preparing for an examination, dictionary, home power control (IOT). Build bot, make yours and others life easier, earn money. Checkout some sample bots in next section.</p>

        <h2>Command line execution</h2>

All you need is to run the cle bot on your machine and you have a monitor ready. It is bandwidth aware and works perfectly on 2g unlike ssh.
